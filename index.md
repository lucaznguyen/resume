**Objectives**

I am currently studying for a Master's in Data Science at VNU-HCM, University of Science. I focus on continual learning and multi-label classification in my research. I have two years of experience working as a data scientist, where I have shown responsibility and skill. My work has given me various abilities, and I am excited to bring my mix of academic learning and practical know-how to a team that values innovation and data-driven solutions.
