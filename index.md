# **Objectives**

I am currently studying for a Master's in Data Science at VNU-HCM, University of Science. I focus on continual learning and multi-label classification in my research. I have two years of experience working as a data scientist, where I have shown responsibility and skill. My work has given me various abilities, and I am excited to bring my mix of academic learning and practical know-how to a team that values innovation and data-driven solutions.

# **Publications**

## Increased Query2Label (IQ) for Small Fine-grained Multi-label Classification
**Authors:** Thinh Nguyen, Phuc Nguyen, Van Nguyen, Linh Tran, Manh Le, Binh Nguyen

**Conference:** KSE 2023

**Abstract:** This paper presents an effective solution to the aforementioned issues. The proposed technique queries the existence of a class label using Transformer decoders and the text embedding method to initiate the query. The new framework is simple, efficient, and consistently outperforms all preceding works on the FATHOMNET, FAIR1M, and DOTA datasets.

## The Effect of Sequence Transferability on Performance and Task Order Selection in Continual Learning
**Authors:** Thinh Nguyen, Cuong N. Nguyen, Quang Pham, Binh T. Nguyen, Savitha Ramasamy, Xiaoli Li, Cuong V. Nguyen

**Conference:** Under review at CVPR 2024

**Abstract:** In this study, we explore the influence of sequence transferability on continual learning, introducing two new, easily calculable metrics to measure the overall transferability of a sequence in both forward and reverse directions. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks reveal a robust correlation between the proposed metrics and the average accuracy across all tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights supporting these correlations, highlighting that transferability in the reverse direction exhibits a stronger correlation than the forward direction, consistent with empirical observations. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce a novel, principled task order selection algorithm that outperforms the conventional strategy of random learning.
